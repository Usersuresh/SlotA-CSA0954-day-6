2.Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise. Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

3.Write a program to print hollow Square Dollar pattern

4.You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row. count no. of soldiers and print weekest row.

5.Develop a programme that uses Multiple Inheritance concepts to compute a student's grades in six subjects. The total and aggregate are then calculated, and the student's grade is displayed. If the student achieves an aggregate of more than 75%, the grade is Distinction. If the aggregate is between 60 and 75, the grade is First Division. If the aggregate is between 50 and 60, the grade is Second Division. If the aggregate is between 40 and 50, the grade is Third Division. Otherwise, the grade is FAIL.
